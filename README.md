RCP (Remote Control Power) is a simple yet effective Windows desktop application designed to help users manage their local network devices. It combines Wake-on-LAN (WOL) capabilities with real-time online status monitoring, making it ideal for home labs, small offices, or tech enthusiasts managing multiple devices.

✅ Wake-on-LAN Support
Remotely power on network devices using their MAC address and broadcast IP. The app automatically sends a WOL magic packet to wake devices.

✅ Live Device Status Monitoring
Devices are pinged periodically to check if they're online or offline, with visual feedback for each device.

✅ Automatic Configuration Handling
Loads device data from an XML config file (DeviceConfig.xml). If the file is missing, the app generates a default configuration to get started quickly.

✅ Background Status Polling
Continuously checks device status in the background at regular intervals, without blocking the UI.

✅ Dynamic Device Cards UI
Each configured device is represented as a card showing its name, IP address, and current status, with buttons for quick interaction.

✅ Helpful Utilities
Built-in help file access and external links for support or more information.
